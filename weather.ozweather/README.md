Script for XBMC for Australian weather.  Available from XBMC master repository.

Uses BOM data and retrieves current conditions, 7 day forecast, and radar images.

Script works fine standalone for standard XBMC weather data, but you need to make skin changes for radar support.  See wiki page for full details.
