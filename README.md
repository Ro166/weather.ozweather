Kodi Oz Weather
===================================

`weather.ozweather`

Script for Kodi for Australian weather with high quality observation, forecast and radar data sourced directly from the BOM.

[!["Buy Me A Coffee"](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bossanova808) 

Available from the Kodi official repository (i.e. _don't_ install from here - just go to Addons -> Get Addons -> Weather -> OzWeather)

Retrieves BOM dat including current conditions, 7-day forecast, and radar images.

Script works with any skin for high quality Australian weather data.  For the best bits, though, you need to make skin changes - which can give you animated BOM radar support.  

See the Kodi [wiki page](http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Add-on:Oz_Weather) for full details and links to the skin patching tool (which you have to install via my private repo as things that modify skins are not allowed in the main Kodi repo).

Contributions of skin files for other skins very gratefully accepted....just message me on the forums & send me your skin files.  (Or request skin support in the forum thread ...and I might even do it for you!).

Support for this addon is via the [forum thread](<https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=116905>), or raise an issue here.
